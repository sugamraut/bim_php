-> To make your code more readable, you can place your functions in a separate file.
   Many PHP add-ons that you download off the Internet contain functions already
   placed into files that you simply include in your PHP program. However, PHP provides
   four functions that enable you to insert code from other files:

  1. include
  2. require
  3. include_once
  4. require_once 

-> All of the include and require functions take a local file as input. require and
   include functions are pretty similar in their functionality except for the way in which
   they handle an irretrievable resource.

-> For example, include and include_once provides a warning if the 
resource cannot be retrieved and tries to continue execution of 
the program. The require and require_once functions provides a 
fatal error and stop execution of the program if they canâ€™t retrieve 
the resource or file.
